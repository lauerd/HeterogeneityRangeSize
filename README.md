# HeterogeneityRangeSize
This repository contains the R code and the associated data files that were used to run all analyses for the manuscript "Habitat and not topographic heterogeneity constrains the range sizes of African mammals" (published in the Journal of Biogeography). To run the code properly, ensure that the "Code" file and the "Data" file are both in the same directory.
